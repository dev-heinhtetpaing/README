ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hein Htet Paing â€” a web developer based in Bangkok. I specialize in building responsive, full-stack web applications using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I enjoy crafting clean UIs with Tailwind CSS, writing scalable APIs, and learning new technologies like TypeScript and AWS.

Iâ€™m currently open to freelance, internship, or full-time opportunities, and always looking to collaborate on meaningful projects. Feel free to check out my work below or reach out if you'd like to connect!
